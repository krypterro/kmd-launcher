KivyMD Launcher is an Android utility for the purposes of designing and testing Kivy and KivyMD application on Android. This application builds with Buildozer into an APK for install on an Android device. You may add whatever additional Python libraries you need to the buildozer.spec file as needed. 

Unlike the previous Kivy Launcher, which apparently did not age well regarding Android security and permissions, this application does not try to execute your apps in their home directory, this app clones your aps to a directory with this application, and runs the app from there. 

This application builds with the latest Kivy and KivyMD.
